# LSHang3r
LSHang3r (a.k.a Lightspeed Hanger or Lightspeed extensions hanger) is an exploit that hangs any of the 3 lightspeed extensions.

# How to use this exploit
Prequistes:
1. Visit your extension page (e.g. chrome://extensions/?id=1234567890) and keep it open. And it should also have "Allow access to file URLs" turned on.
2. Go to one of the sites mentioned in this repository
3. Turn off the v8 optimizer (optional, but recommended)

Steps to hang an extension:
1. When you are reddy, click "Disable" on the extension you wanna hang, this will open a new tab (The Hang3r tab).
2. The second the new tab opens, press ctrl+tab to go to the extension page.
3. Spam the "Allow access to file URLs" button for 5-10 seconds.
4. To finish, either close "The Hang3r" tab, or go to "The Hang3r" tab and press cancel.
5. Profit.

# Credits and other stuff

Credits to @Blobby-Boi and @ading2210 for their exploits (ExtHang3r, LightSPED Killer Agent, ExtPrint3r, and Dextensify) for inspiring me to make this.

What I might plan on adding:
1. about:blank cloaking.
2. the abillity to use on/off switch.
